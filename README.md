# React Navigation v5 mix

This project is part of YouTube tutorial series on React Navigation 5. Here I have used every navigator option available and combine them in a single project to create a seemless user navigation experience for the app user.

Then I have created some extra things such as login, signup & splash screen and provided an authentication flow using AsycStorage. Also I have created form validation for the login screen.
